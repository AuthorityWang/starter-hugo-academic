I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University. I'm also a student researcher at ShanghaiTech VRVC Lab where I am advised by Prof. Jingyi Yu and Prof. Lan Xu. I am passionate about exploring novel ideas and implementing them. My research interest lies in 3d reconstruction and computer graphics with deep learning, including neural rendering, and dynamic scene reconstruction. Recently, I have focused on using neural radiance field based methods to perform real-time, reflection-aware object reconstruction and rendering.
